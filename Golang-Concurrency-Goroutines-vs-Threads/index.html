  <p>This is a fundamental concept in Go and a very common interview question. Understanding the difference shows you grasp why Go is so powerful for concurrent applications.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-distinction-whos-in-charge">The Core Distinction: Who&rsquo;s in Charge?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS Threads:</strong> Managed by the <strong>Operating System (OS)</strong>. The OS kernel decides when to start, stop, and switch threads. It&rsquo;s a heavyweight, system-level operation.</li>
<li><strong>Goroutines:</strong> Managed by the <strong>Go Runtime</strong>. The Go runtime has its own scheduler that runs inside your application. It&rsquo;s a lightweight, application-level operation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analogy: The Restaurant</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS Threads are like Chefs.</strong> Each chef is a powerful, independent worker. But hiring a new chef is a big deal (slow and expensive), and having too many chefs in the kitchen creates a lot of overhead and communication problems.</li>
<li><strong>Goroutines are like Kitchen Helpers.</strong> You can have dozens of helpers. They are cheap to &ldquo;hire&rdquo; (create), take up very little space (memory), and can switch between tasks (chopping, washing, plating) very quickly. A single chef (the Go scheduler) can efficiently manage all the helpers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-does-this-matter">Why Does This Matter?</h2>
<p>The lightweight nature of goroutines is what makes Go so well-suited for modern, concurrent applications like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web Servers:</strong> A web server can handle thousands of incoming connections simultaneously by giving each connection its own goroutine. This would be impossible with OS threads.</li>
<li><strong>Data Pipelines:</strong> You can create complex pipelines where data is processed in stages, with each stage running in its own goroutine.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrent APIs:</strong> Easily make multiple API calls at the same time and wait for all of them to complete.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-go-scheduler-the-chef-in-the-kitchen">The Go Scheduler: The &ldquo;Chef&rdquo; in the Kitchen</h2>
<p>The Go runtime has a sophisticated scheduler that manages all the goroutines. It&rsquo;s responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiplexing:</strong> It takes all your goroutines (the &ldquo;M&rdquo; helpers) and runs them on a small number of OS threads (the &ldquo;N&rdquo; chefs). This is called an <strong>M:N scheduler</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Work-Stealing:</strong> If one OS thread runs out of goroutines to execute, it can &ldquo;steal&rdquo; goroutines from other threads. This keeps all the CPU cores busy.</li>
<li><strong>Handling Blocking Calls:</strong> If a goroutine makes a blocking call (like reading from a file or a network connection), the scheduler will move it off the OS thread and let another goroutine run. This prevents the entire thread from being blocked.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-for-your-interview">Key Takeaways for Your Interview</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Goroutines are not threads.</strong> They are a higher-level abstraction.</li>
<li><strong>Goroutines are managed by the Go runtime, threads are managed by the OS.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Goroutines are much more lightweight and scalable than threads.</strong> This is the primary reason Go is so good at concurrency.</li>
<li>The Go runtime uses an <strong>M:N scheduler</strong> to efficiently run many goroutines on a few OS threads.</li>
</ul>
