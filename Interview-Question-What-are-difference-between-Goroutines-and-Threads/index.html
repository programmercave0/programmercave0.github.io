  <p>If you&rsquo;re preparing for a software engineering interview, it&rsquo;s important to understand the difference between goroutines and threads. These two concepts are related to concurrency, which is the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. In this blog, we&rsquo;ll break down the key differences between goroutines and threads in a simple and efficient way.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Goroutines are managed by the Go runtime, while threads are managed by the operating system.</li>
<li>Goroutines are lightweight and consume less memory than threads.</li>
<li>Context switching is faster in goroutines compared to threads due to the Go runtime scheduler&rsquo;s efficient mechanism.</li>
<li>Goroutines can be created and managed in large numbers due to their lightweight nature.</li>
<li>Goroutines provide a higher-level abstraction compared to threads.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/Interview-Question-What-are-Goroutines/">What are Goroutines?</a></p>
<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<p>The first key difference between goroutines and threads is how they are managed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threads</strong> are managed by the operating system (OS). The OS scheduler is responsible for scheduling threads onto CPU cores. This means that the OS has direct control over when and how threads are executed.</li>
<li><strong>Goroutines</strong>, on the other hand, are managed by the Go runtime. The Go runtime has its own scheduler that multiplexes goroutines onto a pool of OS threads. This allows Go to manage concurrency at the application level without direct OS involvement.</li>
</ul>

</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="weight">Weight</h2>
<p>Another important difference between goroutines and threads is their weight, or the amount of resources they consume.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threads</strong> are relatively heavy. They consume a significant amount of memory, often requiring 1-2 MB of stack space. This means that creating a large number of threads can quickly use up system resources.</li>
<li><strong>Goroutines</strong> are very lightweight. They start with a small stack, typically around 2KB. The stack can grow and shrink as needed, making them much more memory-efficient.</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Threads</th>
<th>Goroutines</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Weight</td>
<td>Heavy (1-2 MB)</td>
<td>Lightweight (2KB)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="context-switching">Context Switching</h2>
<p>Context switching is the process of saving and restoring the state of a thread or goroutine so that it can be resumed later. This is an important aspect of concurrency because it allows the system to switch between different tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Threads</strong> involve context switching by the OS, which can be expensive. The OS has to save and restore the state of the thread, including registers and other resources. This can take a significant amount of time and resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goroutines</strong> use a much faster context switching mechanism within the Go runtime. Switching between goroutines is managed by the Go runtime scheduler, which is more efficient than OS-level context switching. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stack Management</strong>: Goroutines have a dynamic stack size that grows and shrinks as needed. This allows the Go runtime to efficiently manage the memory used by each goroutine.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduler</strong>: The Go runtime scheduler uses a work-stealing algorithm to distribute goroutines across available OS threads. This ensures that all CPU cores are utilized effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Context Switching</strong>: When a goroutine needs to be switched out, the Go runtime saves its current state, including the stack pointer and program counter. It then loads the state of the next goroutine to be executed. This process is much faster than OS-level context switching because it doesn&rsquo;t involve saving and restoring as many resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Threads</th>
<th>Goroutines</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Context Switching</td>
<td>Expensive (OS-level)</td>
<td>Fast (Go runtime)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="creation-and-scalability">Creation and Scalability</h2>
<p>When it comes to creating and managing a large number of concurrent tasks, goroutines have a clear advantage over threads.</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a large number of <strong>threads</strong> can be resource-intensive, and the system may run out of resources at a lower number. This is because each thread consumes a significant amount of memory.</li>
<li>Go can create and manage hundreds of thousands of <strong>goroutines</strong> in the same address space due to their lightweight nature and efficient runtime management. This makes goroutines a better choice for applications that require a large number of concurrent tasks.</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Threads</th>
<th>Goroutines</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Creation and Scalability</td>
<td>Resource-intensive</td>
<td>Efficient</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h2>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s look at the level of abstraction provided by threads and goroutines.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threads</strong> are a lower-level abstraction that directly maps to OS threads. This means that working with threads requires a good understanding of the underlying OS and hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Goroutines</strong> are a higher-level abstraction that is independent of the underlying OS threads. The Go runtime manages the mapping between goroutines and threads, making it easier to work with concurrency in Go.</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Threads</th>
<th>Goroutines</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Abstraction</td>
<td>Lower-level</td>
<td>Higher-level</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In conclusion, goroutines and threads are both used to achieve concurrency in software programs, but they have some key differences. Understanding these differences will help you prepare for your software engineering interview and write more efficient and scalable code.</p>
