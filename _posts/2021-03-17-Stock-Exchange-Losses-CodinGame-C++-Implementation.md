<h1>Problem:</h1>

A finance company is carrying out a study on the worst stock investments and would like to acquire a program to do so. The program must be able to analyze a chronological series of stock values in order to show the largest loss that it is possible to make by buying a share at a given time `t0` and by selling it at a later date `t1`. The loss will be expressed as the difference in value between `t0` and `t1`. If there is no loss, the loss will be worth `0`.

<h3>Input</h3>
Line 1: the number `n` of stock values available.

Line 2: the stock values arranged in order, from the date of their introduction on the stock market V<sub>1</sub> until the last known value V<sub>n</sub>. The values are integers.

<h3>Output</h3>

The maximal loss `p`, expressed negatively if there is a loss, otherwise `0`.

<h1>Solution:</h1>

The input values are the stock price at particular time. We will store these stock prices in an integer vector `values`.  The index of the vector denotes time and element at that index is the stock price at that particular time.

The three given test cases are : 
```
Input
6
3 2 4 2 1 5

Output
-3
```

```
Input
6
5 3 4 2 3 1

Output
-4
```

```
Input

1 2 4 4 5

Output
0
```

From the above test cases, we can figure it out that only when stock price at `t2` is less than stock price at `t1` (where `t2` > `t1`), then there is loss, else loss is 0.

So only when `values[i]` > `values[j]` we will process further. Here `i` and `j` are iterable variables in loop(s). `i` is initialised with `0` and `j` is with `i+1`. 

Before going further, we should intialise all variables we need.

```
int loss = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
int maxima = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();
int minima = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
int maxima_index = 0, minima_index = 0;
```

While `i` = 0, `j` will iterate from `i+1` to `values.size() - 1`.

And, when condition `values[i] > values[j]` is false, then the value of `i` becomes the last value of `j`.
 
In fig 1, `i = 0` and at `j = 2` (i.e V<sub>3</sub>), the condition `values[i] > values[j]` is false. So the new value of `i` is 2 and value of `j` is 3 (i.e `i+1`).
 
In fig 1, from V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>2</sub>, the condition `values[i] > values[j]` is true. So this is one section of graph where we will calculate loss. This loss will be stored in an integer variable `local_loss`. There will be many sections in graph where we will calculate the `local_loss` and update variable `loss` with lowest values (i.e. highest loss). The values will be in negative so lowest value means highest loss.
 
Similarly, integer variable `maxima` and `minima` will store the maximum and minimum values in the graph, but the condition is that `maxima_index` < `minima_index`.

As the program proceeds, the value of these variables change.

The value of variables `maxima` and `minima` will change only when `values[i]` >= `maxima`. This means we have found the new maximum in the graph, so `maxima` is updated. And `minima` is updated because its index must be greater than the index of `maxima`.

So, we can only update value of `minima`, `maxima`, `minima_index` and `maxima_index` if conditions `values[i] > values[j]` and `local_loss < loss` and `values[i] >= maxima` are `true`.
 
In fig 1, from V<sub>1</sub>(`i = 0`) to V<sub>2</sub>(`j = 1`), `maxima` is 3 and `minima` is 2 and `loss` is -1. From V<sub>3</sub>(`i = 2`) to V<sub>4</sub>(`j = 3`), the `loss` becomes -2.The `values[i]`(=4) is also greater than `maxima`(=3). Thus all conditons `values[i] > values[j]` and `local_loss < loss` and `values[i] >= maxima` are true. So `maxima` and `minima` is updated.

At V<sub>3</sub>(`i = 2`) and V<sub>5</sub>(`j = 4`) again all conditions are true and new value of `loss` is calculated.
 
```
int i = 0;
int j = i+1;

while (j < values.size())
{
    if (values[i] > values[j])
    {
        int local_loss = values[j] - values[i];

        if (local_loss < loss)
        {
            loss = local_loss;
            if (values[i] >= maxima)
            {
                maxima = values[i];
                maxima_index = i;
                minima = values[j];
                minima_index = j;
            }
        }
    }
    else if (values[i] < values[j])
    {
        i = j;
        j = i;
    }
    j++;
}
```
 
For the third test case, the condition `values[i] > values[j]` is never true. So, variable `loss` is never updated and it stores the highest value integer can store.

Since `minima` and `maxima` are also never updated and so there indices are 0. Thus the loss will be 0. 
```
loss = values[minima_index] - values[maxima_index];
```

<h3>C++ Implementation</h3>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>

int largest_loss(std::vector<int>& values)
{
    int loss = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();

    int maxima = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();
    int minima = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
    int maxima_index = 0, minima_index = 0;

    int i = 0;
 
    int j = i+1;

    while (j < values.size())
    {
        if (values[i] > values[j])
        {
            int local_loss = values[j] - values[i];

            if (local_loss < loss)
            {
                loss = local_loss;
                if (values[i] >= maxima)
                {
                    maxima = values[i];
                    maxima_index = i;
                    minima = values[j];
                    minima_index = j;
                }
            }

        }
        else if (values[i] < values[j])
        {
            i = j;
            j = i;
        }
        j++;
    }
    loss = values[minima_index] - values[maxima_index];
    return loss;
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    std::cin >> n; std::cin.ignore();
    std::vector<int> values(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        std::cin >> values[i]; 
        std::cin.ignore();
    }

    int loss = largest_loss(values);

    std::cout << loss << std::endl;
}
```
