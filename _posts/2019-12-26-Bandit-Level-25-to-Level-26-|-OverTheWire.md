## [Bandit Level 25 → Level 26](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit26.html)

### Level Goal

Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

### Commands you may need to solve this level

ssh, cat, more, vi, ls, id, pwd

### Solution : 

Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `****` .

There is a private key in the file *bandit26.sshkey* in */home/bandit25* directory. If we use this private key to login as user *bandit26* using command `ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost` we are logged out. We receive a message “*Connection to localhost closed*”.

![Bandit Level 25 26]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l2526_terminal1.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Lets find some information of user bandit25 and bandit26. bandit25 uses */bin/sh* shell and bandit26 uses something */usr/bin/showtext*.

![Bandit Level 25 26]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l2526_terminal2.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Lets see what is inside the showtext file. The content is
``` 
#!/bin/sh
export TERM=linux
more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```

![Bandit Level 25 26]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l2526_terminal3.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Before exiting, command more `~/text.txt` is executed.

`more` is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time. With command `v` we can start up an editor at current line.  The editor is taken from the environment variable VISUAL if defined, or EDITOR if VISUAL is not defined, or defaults to vi if neither VISUAL nor EDITOR is defined.

To enable `more` we have to decrease size of our terminal window.

![Bandit Level 25 26]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l2526_terminal4.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Enter command `ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost`.

![Bandit Level 25 26]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l2526_terminal5.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

After typing `v` we enter into vim editor then enter `:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26` to view password for next level. The password for next level is `****` .

## [Bandit Level 26 → Level 27](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit27.html)

### Level Goal

Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

### Commands you may need to solve this level

ls

### Solution : 

Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `****` .

Before running the above command, shrink the terminal window like we have done in previous level.

Enter `v` to start up an editor mode. Command `:set shell ?` will tell the shell of the user and `:set shell=/bin/sh` will set it to */bin/sh*. Run `:set shell ?` again to confirm.

To execute a command in subshell, enter `:!command`. Lets execute `:!ls -la`.

There is a *bandit27-do* file with elevated privilege. It will help us to know the password.

![Bandit Level 26 27]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l2627_terminal1.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Run command 
```
:! ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
```

and the password is `****` .
