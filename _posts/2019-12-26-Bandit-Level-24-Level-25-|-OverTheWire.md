## [Bandit Level 24 → Level 25](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit25.html)

### Level Goal

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

### Solution : 

Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ` .

We can connect on port 30002 in a same way as we have done in level 20. We also have to pass password for current level and the 4 digit pin.The command is
```
nc localhost 30002  UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ ****
```

To brute-force pin we wil write a shell script in */tmp/mydir123* directory.
 
The script is
``` 
#!/bin/bash
for i in {0000..9999}
do 
	echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i"
done
```

The name of the script is *bruteforcescript.sh* and file *combinations.txt* will store all combinations of 4 digit number with password for bandit20. First we have to make bruteforcescript.sh executable using command 
```
chmod 700 bruteforcescript.sh
./bruteforcescript.sh > combinations.txt
```

And the final command is
```
nc localhost 30002 < combinations.txt
```
The password for the next level is `****` .
