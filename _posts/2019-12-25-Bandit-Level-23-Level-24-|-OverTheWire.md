Learn linux command by playing [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame. The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames. Below is the solution of Bandit Level 23 → Level 24. 

In this level we will learn about corntab files and write our first shell-script in this series. 

The passwords are hidden, so you have to find the passwords for next level yourself.

## [Bandit Level 23 → Level 24](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit24.html)

### Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE:** This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

**NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…

### Commands you may need to solve this level

cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)

### Solution : 

Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit23@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `****` .

Execute these commands to know the content of crontab file and then content of the script file.
```
cd /etc/cron.d/
ls
cat cronjob_bandit24
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
```

The script in *cronjob_bandit24.sh* is :
```
#!/bin/bash
myname=$(whoami)
cd /var/spool/$myname
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
	echo "Handling $i"
	timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
	rm -f ./$i
    fi
done
```

The command `cd /vars/pool/$myname` will change to *bandit24* directory and then all scripts in directory *bandit24* will be executed and then deleted. This is done in every 60 seconds as `timeout` is provided.

![Bandit Level 23 24]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l2324_terminal1.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

So if we put our script in */var/spool/bandit24* then it will be executed and then deleted. So we will write our script such that it will output password for next level.

We will create a directory *pcdir123* in */tmp* directory and change the permissions to readable, writeable and executable for *pcdir123*. (This is very important). The command are:
```
mkdir /tmp/pcdir123
chmod 777 pcdir123
```

![Bandit Level 23 24]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l2324_terminal2.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Now create a script file *pass24script.sh* in */tmp/pcdir123* which will contain our script. The script is 
```
#!/bin/sh
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/pcdir123/pass24file
```

*pass24script.sh* is not executable, so make it executable for all users using command `chmod 777 pass24script`.

![Bandit Level 23 24]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l2324_terminal3.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Copy this script in */var/spool/bandit/24* using command `cp pass24script.sh /var/spool/bandit24`

When new minute starts, file pass24file is produced with password for the next level if the directory pcdir123 has write permission enabled. The password is `****` .
