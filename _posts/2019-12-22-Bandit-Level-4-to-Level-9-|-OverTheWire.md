Learn linux command by playing [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame. The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames. Below is the solution of Level 4 → Level 5, Level 5 → Level 6, Level 6 → Level 7, Level 7 → Level 8, and Level 8 → Level 9. 

In this post we will learn how to find a human readable file with certain size in bytes and with certain user.

The passwords are hidden, so you have to find the passwords for next level yourself.

## [Bandit Level 4 → Level 5](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit5.html)

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the **inhere** directory.<br/> Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

### Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

### Solution : 

Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is  `****` .

`file` command is used to determine a file’s type or what file contains.

In *inhere* directory, there are 10 files *-file00, -file01, …, -file09*. The human-readable file means the content of that file is ASCII and we can find the type of content of a file by running command 
```
file ./-file00 
```
```
file ./-file01
```
...
```
file ./file07
```

We found that *-file07* contains ASCII text.

Instead of checking each file we can use `find` and `xargs` command.

`find` program searches a given directory (and its subdirectories) for files based on a variety of attributes.
 
Command `find . -type f` searches all regular files in the current directory. Current directory is specified by . (dot).

The `xargs` command performs an interesting function. It accepts input from standard input and converts it into an argument list for a specified command. 

Command `find . -type f | xargs file` finds all the regular files in the current directory and `xargs` constructs an argument list for `file` command and then executes it.

The password for the next level is `****` .

## [Bandit Level 5 → Level 6](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit6.html)

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the **inhere** directory and has all of the following properties:<br/>
 * human-readable 
 * 1033 bytes in size 
 * not executable 

### Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

### Solution : 

Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is  `****` .

In manual pages of `find` command it is mentioned that option `-size` is used to specify size of the file and `c` is used for bytes. `-executable` matches the executable files, so `! -executables` matches the non executable files. We then pipe this output to `xargs` command which tells the content of the file found. Command is 

```
find . -type f -size 1033c ! - executable | xargs file
```

The password for the next level is `****` .

## [Bandit Level 6 → Level 7](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit7.html)

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is **stored somewhere on the server** and has all of the following properties:<br/>
 * owned by user bandit7 
 * owned by group bandit6 
 * 33 bytes in size 

### Commands you may need to solve this level

ls, cd, cat, file, du, find, grep

### Solution :
 
Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `****` .

Since the password is stored *somewhere on the server*. Lets go to the root directory by running command `cd ..` two times.

From manual page of `find` command :

 `-user` *uname*<br/>
    File is owned by user uname (numeric user ID allowed).<br/>
 `-size` *n[cwbkMG]*<br/>
    File uses n units of space, rounding up.  The following suffixes can be used:<br/>
    'c'    for bytes<br/>
 `-group` *gname*
    File belongs to group gname (numeric group ID allowed).<br/>

From the given, `uname` is *bandit7*, `gname` is *bandit6* and `n` is *33c*.

We want file with ASCII content and `xargs file` will tell us about that.

So the command is :
```
find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c | xargs file
```

The password for the next level is `****` .

## [Bandit Level 7 → Level 8](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit8.html)

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** next to the word **millionth**

### Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

### Solution :
 
Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `****` .

Here we can use `grep` program. `grep` is used to find text patterns within file. The text we have to find is *millionth* and the password for next level is next to it.

The command is :
```
cat data.txt | grep millionth
```
The password for next level is `****` .

## [Bandit Level 8 → Level 9](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit9.html)

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** and is the only line of text that occurs only once

### Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

### Solution :
 
Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `****` .

We will use command `sort` to sort all texts in the file. Command `uniq` with option `u` i.e. `uniq -u` only prints unique lines. So the command is :
```
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```

and password is `****` .
