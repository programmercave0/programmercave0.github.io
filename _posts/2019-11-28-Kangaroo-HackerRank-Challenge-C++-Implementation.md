<h1>Problem:</h1>

You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos o a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).
 
• The first kangaroo starts at location `x1` and moves at a rate of `v1` meters per jump. <br/>
• The second kangaroo starts at location `x2` and moves at a rate of `v2` meters per jump. 

You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is possible, return `YES`, otherwise return `NO`.

For example, kangaroo 1 starts at `x1 = 2` with a jump distance `v1 = 1` and kangaroo 2 starts at `x2 = 1` with a jump distance of `v2 = 2`. After one jump, they are both at `x = 3` , (`x1 + v1 = 2 + 1`, `x2 + v2 = 1 + 2`), so our answer is `YES`.

<h1>Solution:</h1>

Here `pos1` is current position of kangaroo 1 and `pos2` is current position of kangaroo2. `speed1` is speed of kangaroo 1 and `speed2` is speed of kangaroo 2. `difference` stores the initial difference between their starting positions. The kangaroo whose position is last should cover that distance in `difference` number of steps because the minimum speed for a kangaroo is `1`.

```cpp
std::string no = "NO";
std::string yes = "YES";
int difference = abs(pos1 - pos2);
```

The next position for kangaroos is `pos1 = pos1 + speed1` and `pos2 = pos2 + speed2`. If `pos1` is equal to `pos2` means they met and answer is `YES`.

**Case 1:** When starting positions of both kangaroo are different i.e. `pos1 != pos2` and `difference != 0`.

Then a loop will run for `difference` number of times and in each step their current positions are updated and if their updated current positions are equal then return `YES`. 

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < difference; ++i)
{
	pos1 = pos1 + speed1;
	pos2 = pos2 + speed2;
	if (pos1 == pos2)
	{
		return yes;
	}
}
if (pos1 != pos2)
{
	return no;
}
```

**Case 2:** When starting positions of both kangaroo are same i.e. `pos1 == pos2` and `difference == 0`.

Then next position is calculated `pos1 = pos1 + speed1` and `pos2 = pos2 + speed2` and if their speeds are different then new `difference` is calculated and proceed as case 1. If their speeds are same then they will meet in second step.

```cpp
if (difference == 0 && speed1 != speed2)
{
	pos1 = pos1 + speed1;
	pos2 = pos2 + speed2;
	difference = abs(pos1 - pos2);
}
else if (difference == 0 && speed1 == speed2)
{
	return yes;
}
```

The kangaroos will never meet if the kangaroo whose is ahead has more speed than the last kangaroo.

```cpp
if ((pos1 > pos2 && speed1 > speed2) || (pos2 > pos1 && speed2 > speed1))
{
	return no; 
}
```

<h3>C++ Implementation</h3>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
#include <string>

std::string does_meet(int pos1, int speed1, int pos2, int speed2)
{
	std::string no = "NO";
	std::string yes = "YES";
	int difference = abs(pos1 - pos2);

	if (difference == 0 && speed1 != speed2)
	{
		pos1 = pos1 + speed1;
		pos2 = pos2 + speed2;
		difference = abs(pos1 - pos2);
	}
	else if (difference == 0 && speed1 == speed2)
	{
		return yes;
	}

	if ((pos1 > pos2 && speed1 > speed2) || (pos2 > pos1 && speed2 > speed1))
	{
		return no; 
	}
	else
	{
		for (int i = 0; i < difference; ++i)
		{
			pos1 = pos1 + speed1;
			pos2 = pos2 + speed2;
			if (pos1 == pos2)
			{
				return yes;
			}
		}
		if (pos1 != pos2)
		{
			return no;
		}
	}
	return no;
}

int main()
{
	int x1, x2, v1, v2;
	std::cin >> x1 >> v1 >> x2 >> v2;

	std::string result = does_meet(x1, v1, x2, v2);
	std::cout << result << "\n";
}
```
