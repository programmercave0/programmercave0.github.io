## [Bandit Level 9 → Level 10](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit10.html)

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** in one of the few human-readable strings, beginning with several ‘=’ characters.

### Commands you may need to solve this level
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

### Solution : 
Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `****` .

Command `strings` print the sequences of printable characters in files and `grep =` will print lines with ‘=’ in it. The command is :
```
strings data.txt | grep =
```

and the password for next level is `****` .

## [Bandit Level 10 → Level 11](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit11.html)

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which contains base64 encoded data

### Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

### Solution :
 
Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `****` .

Command `base64` with option `-d` decodes the file. So the command is
``` 
base64 -d data.txt
```

and the password is `****` .

## [Bandit Level 11 → Level 12](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit12.html)

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

### Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

### Solution : 

Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `****` .

Command `tr` is used to translate character. Since characters are rotated by 13 positions means *a* becomes *n* and *n* becomes *a*, *b* becomes *o* and *o* becomes *b* and so on. The command is
``` 
cat data.txt | tr "[a-zA-Z]" "[n-za-mN-ZA-M]"
```

and the password for the next level is `****` .
