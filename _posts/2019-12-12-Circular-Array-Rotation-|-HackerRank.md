This is an easy hackerrank challenge which will help you to become good at competitive programming. There are various competitive programming websites like [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/), [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) where you can practice coding.

<h1>Problem :</h1>

John Watson knows of an operation called a *right circular rotation* on an array of integers. One rotation operation moves the last array element to the first position and shifts all remaining elements right one. To test Sherlock's abilities, Watson provides Sherlock with an array of integers. Sherlock is to perform the rotation operation a number of times then determine the value of the element at a given position.
For each array, perform a number of right circular rotations and return the value of the element at a given index.

For example, array *a = [3, 4, 5]*, number of rotations, *k = 2* and indices to check, *m = [1, 2]*. 

First we perform the two rotations: <br/>
*[3, 4, 5] → [5, 3, 4] → [4, 5, 3]*

Now return the values from the zero-based indices 1 and 2 as indicated in the m array.<br/>
*a[1] = 5*
*a[2] = 3*

<h2>Solution : </h2>

`array` is the input array, integer variable `num_of_rotations` stores the number of rotations to be performed on the input array and array `indices_to_check` stores the indices to be checked after rotation.

If number of rotations is equal to the size of the input array then input array and array after rotation are same.

If number of rotations is greater than the size of the input array then array after `num_of_rotations` times rotation is equal to the array after `num_of_rotations – array.size()` times rotations.

For eg. if the size of array is *3* and number of rotations are *5* then array after 5 rotations is equal to the array after 2 rotations.

![Cirular Array Rotation HackerRank]({{ site.url }}/assets/2019-12-12-Circular-Array-Rotation/HR_circulararrayrotation.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

```cpp
int arr_size = array.size();
while (num_of_rotations > arr_size)
{
    num_of_rotations = num_of_rotations - arr_size;
}
```

If we imagine array as a circular array then element after the last element is the element at the first position. So after first circular rotation the last element is moved to the first position and the element at first position is moved to second position and so on all the elements are moved to maintain the order of the array.

For eg. in the array *[3, 4, 5]* after first rotation *5* is moved to the first position and the element after *5* in circular array is *3* so *3* comes after *5* and so on . After first rotation the array is *[5, 3, 4]*.

Instead of rotating step by step, we declare an array `new_array` which stores the elements in order after `num_of_rotations` times rotation. The first element after all rotations on the input array is `array[array.size() - num_of_rotations]`.

For eg. in the `array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `num_of_rotations` is `3`, the `new_array` will store elements from index `array.size() - num_of_rotations` to last index in the `array` i.e. elements *4, 5, 6*.<br/>
`new_array = [4, 5, 6]`

{% include ads.html %}<br/>

And then the elements from index `0` to index `array.size() - num_of_rotations – 1` are added to the `new_array` i.e. elements *1, 2, 3*.<br/>
`new_array = [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3].`

```cpp
std::vector<int> new_array;
for (int i = arr_size - num_of_rotations; i < arr_size; ++i)
{
    new_array.push_back(array[i]);
}
for (int i = 0; i < arr_size - num_of_rotations; ++i)
{
    new_array.push_back(array[i]);
}
```

To store the elements at the indices stored in the array `indices_to_check`, an array `res` is declared.

```cpp
std::vector<int> res;
for(int i = 0; i < indices_to_check.size(); ++i)
{
    int idx = indices_to_check[i];
    int val = new_array[idx];
    res.push_back(val);
}
```

<h3>C++ Implementation</h3>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> circular_array_rotation(const std::vector<int>& array, int num_of_rotations, const std::vector<int>& indices_to_check) 
{
    int arr_size = array.size();
    while (num_of_rotations > arr_size)
    {
        num_of_rotations = num_of_rotations - arr_size;
    }

    std::vector<int> new_array;
    for (int i = arr_size - num_of_rotations; i < arr_size; ++i)
    {
        new_array.push_back(array[i]);
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < arr_size - num_of_rotations; ++i)
    {
        new_array.push_back(array[i]);
    }

    std::vector<int> res;
    for(int i = 0; i < indices_to_check.size(); ++i)
    {
        int idx = indices_to_check[i];
        int val = new_array[idx];
        res.push_back(val);
    }
   
    return res;
}

int main()
{
    int num_of_elements, num_of_rotations, num_of_indices_to_check;
    std::cin >> num_of_elements >> num_of_rotations >> num_of_indices_to_check;

    std::vector<int> array(num_of_elements);
    std::vector<int> indices_to_check(num_of_indices_to_check);

    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_elements; ++i)
    {
        std::cin >> array[i];
    }    

    for (int i = 0; i < num_of_indices_to_check; ++i)
    {
        std::cin >> indices_to_check[i];
    }

    std::vector<int> result = circular_array_rotation(array, num_of_rotations, indices_to_check);
    for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); ++i)
    {
        std::cout << result[i] << "\n";
    }
}
```
