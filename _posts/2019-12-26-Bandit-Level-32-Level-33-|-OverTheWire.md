THE UPPERCASE SHELL is converting every command into uppercase.                  

`$0` expands to the name of the shell or shell script. This is set at shell initialization. If bash is invoked with a file of commands, `$0` is set to the name of that file.

`$0` helps us to come out of the interactive mode.

After running `ls -la` we found that uppershell has escalated privilege as user bandit33. `echo $SHELL` tells us the current shell which is uppershell. The command is
``` 
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33 
```

and the password is `****` .
