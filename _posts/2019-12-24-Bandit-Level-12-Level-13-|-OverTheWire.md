Learn linux command by playing [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame. The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames. Below is the solution of Level 12 → Level 13. 

In this post we will learn about various compression techniques and how to decompress file. We will learn how to convert binary to hex file and vice-versa.

The passwords are hidden, so you have to find the passwords for next level yourself.

## [Bandit Level 12 → Level 13](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit13.html)

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

### Commands you may need to solve this level

grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file

### Solution : 

Command to connect remote host : `ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` password is `****` .

As mentioned in question make a new directory in /tmp and rename the file.

![Bandit Level 12 13]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l1213_terminal1.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

`xxd` program is used to make a hexdump or to do the reverse. Option `-r` convert hexdump into the binary. File `myfile.txt` is a hexdump and convert it into a binary file `myfile1.bin` using command
```
xxd -r myfile.txt > myfile1.bin
```

![Bandit Level 12 13]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l1213_terminal2.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Using command `file myfile1.bin` , we found that `myfile1.bin` is a *gzip compressed data*.

`zcat` is a program supplied with `gzip` and is used to decompress *gzip compressed files*.
```
zcat myfile1.bin > myfile2
```

![Bandit Level 12 13]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l1213_terminal3.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Again using `file` command on `myfile2`, we found that it is *bzip2 compressed data*.

`bzcat` program is supplied with `bzip2` and is used to decompress *bzip2 compressed files*.
```
bzcat myfile2 > myfile3
```

![Bandit Level 12 13]({{ site.url }}/assets/Bandit-Overthewire/bandit_l1213_terminal4.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}


`myfile3` is *gzip compressed file* so use `zcat` program to decompress it in `myfile4`. `myfile4` is a POSIX tar archive.

`tar` program is used for archiving file and options `x` is used to extract an archive, `f` is used to specify name of the tar archive and `v` is used for more detailed listing.
```
tar -xvf myfile4
```

This command outputs file `data5.bin` which is again a *tar archive*. Again use `tar` program on `data5.bin` which outputs `data6.bin`. `data6.bin` is a *bzip2 compressed file* and use `bzcat` program to decompress it to `myfile7`.
 
`myfile7` is a *tar archive* and use tar program which outputs `data8.bin`. `data8.bin` is a *gzip compressed file* and use `zcat` to decompress it to file `myfile9`.

`myfile9` contains *ASCII text* and `cat myfile9` tells the password for the next level.

The password for the next level is `****` .
