<td><strong>High:</strong> The TCP header is larger (20 bytes) due to sequence numbers, acknowledgments, etc.</td>
<td><strong>Low:</strong> The UDP header is much smaller (8 bytes).</td>

<td>Use Cases</td>
<td>Web Browse (HTTP/S), file transfers (FTP), email (SMTP), database connections. Anything where data integrity is paramount.</td>
<td>Video/audio streaming, online gaming, DNS, VoIP. Anything where speed is more critical than 100% reliability.</td>

<h3 id="how-tcp-achieves-reliability">How TCP Achieves Reliability</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>3-Way Handshake:</strong> This is how a connection is established.
<ol>
<li>SYN: The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to initiate a connection.</li>
<li>SYN-ACK: The server replies with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment) packet.</li>
<li>ACK: The client responds with an ACK (acknowledgment) packet, and the connection is established. Data transfer can now begin.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Sequence Numbers and Acknowledgments (ACKs)</strong>: Each byte of data is given a sequence number. The receiver sends ACKs to confirm which bytes it has received. If the sender doesn&rsquo;t receive an ACK for a packet within a certain time, it retransmits the packet.</li>
<li><strong>Flow Control:</strong> The receiver has a receive buffer. It uses a &ldquo;window size&rdquo; in its ACK packets to tell the sender how much buffer space is available. This prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver. This is the sliding window mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Congestion Control:</strong> This is different from flow control. Flow control is about the receiver; congestion control is about the network itself. TCP assumes that packet loss is due to network congestion. When a packet is lost, the sender slows down its transmission rate to reduce the load on the network. It does this by adjusting its congestion window using algorithms like &ldquo;slow start&rdquo; and &ldquo;congestion avoidance.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-to-choose-udp-and-how-to-build-reliability-on-top">When to Choose UDP (and how to build reliability on top)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Answer: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d choose UDP for latency-sensitive applications like real-time video streaming. In video, a dropped frame is better than a delayed frame that arrives late. While UDP itself is unreliable, we can build &lsquo;pseudo-reliability&rsquo; at the application layer. For example, we might not need to retransmit every lost packet, but we could implement our own logic to request a keyframe if a critical video frame is lost. This gives us more control over the trade-off between latency and reliability than TCP allows. The QUIC protocol, which underlies HTTP/3, is a great example of this—it&rsquo;s built on UDP but implements its own streams, reliability, and congestion control.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
