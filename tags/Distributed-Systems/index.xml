      <title>Interview Question: Explain Consistent Hashing</title>

      <description>What is Consistent Hashing? Imagine you’re distributing candy (data) among friends (servers). If a friend leaves or joins, you don’t want to reshuffle all the candy—only what’s necessary. Consistent hashing solves this problem by minimizing data movement when servers (nodes) are added or removed. It’s used by companies like Discord, Netflix, and Amazon DynamoDB to scale their systems efficiently.
 How Consistent Hashing Works: A Step-by-Step Guide 1. The Hash Ring: A Circular Timeline Think of a hash ring as a clock face.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Explain Load Balancer</title>

      <description>What is a Load Balancer? A load balancer acts like a traffic cop for your application, directing incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure smooth performance. It’s the entry point of your system, hiding server details and optimizing traffic flow.
 Placement: Sits at the edge of data centers (like a gatekeeper). Functionality:  Distributes traffic to servers. Proxies requests to hide server IPs (e.g., clients only see the load balancer’s IP).</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Explain CAP Theorem</title>

      <description>1. What is the CAP Theorem? The CAP Theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three properties at the same time:
 Consistency (C): All users see the same data simultaneously. Availability (A): The system always responds to requests (even with stale data). Partition Tolerance (P): The system works even if parts of it lose communication.  Key Insight: Network partitions (e.g., server crashes, dropped messages) are unavoidable.</description>
