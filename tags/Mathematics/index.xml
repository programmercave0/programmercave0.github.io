      <description>Introduction Prime numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.&#xA;In this blog, we will discuss different methods to check if a number is a prime number or not, and analyze their time complexity.</description>

      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Bank-Robbers-CodinGame-Challenge-Cpp-Implementation/</guid>
      <description>The problem is from CodinGame with difficulty level Easy and tagged under Loops and Mathematics.&#xA;A gang of R foolish robbers decides to heist a bank. In the bank there are V vaults (indexed from 0 to V-1). The robbers have managed to extract some information from the bank&amp;rsquo;s director:&#xA;The combination of a vault is composed of C characters (digits/vowels). The first N characters consist of digits from 0 to 9.</description>
