      <description>Apache Kafka is a cornerstone of modern real-time data pipelines, but handling consumer lag is a common challenge that can affect system performance. This blog dives into what consumer lag is, its causes, and how to tackle it effectively.
This question was asked to me by Procore for the role of Senior Software Engineer.

      <description>Introduction: Kafka is a popular distributed streaming platform that is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to handle high-volume data streams in real-time and provide reliable and scalable data streaming. Kafka is used for a wide range of applications, including real-time analytics, monitoring, log aggregation, and messaging systems.
In this blog post, we will demonstrate how to read Kafka messages in Go and store them in a PostgreSQL database.</description>
