      <description>When edges connects all vertices in a graph and form a tree then it is known as spanning tree. While connecting edges no cycle should be formed. A minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.&#xA;Initially no vertices are connected to any other vertex means the spanning tree does not contain any edges, it only contain vertices. Kruskal’s algorithm adds an edge to the tree which has the smallest weight if it does not create a cycle.</description>

      <description>Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm finds shortest paths from the source vertex to all vertices in the graph. The condition for the algorithm is that all edge weights should be non-negative. Thus, Dijkstra’s algorithm is efficient than the Bellman-Ford algorithm because it processes each edge only once, since it knows that there are no negative-weight edges in the graph.&#xA;In fig. (a) there is no negative-weight cycle, fig. (b) contains a negative-weight cycle</description>

      <description>Bellman–Ford algorithm finds shortest path from the source vertex to all vertices in the graph. The graph can contain negative-weight edges, but it should not contain a negative-weight cycle that is reachable from the source vertex.&#xA;The algorithm returns TRUE if there is no negative-weight cycle and FALSE if there is a negative-weight cycle reachable from the source vertex. If there is a negative-weight cycle that is reachable from source vertex, then no solution exists.</description>

      <description>Breadth first search (BFS) explores the graph level by level. First it explore every vertex that is connected to source vertex. If the vertex is discovered, it becomes gray or black. Initially all the vertices are white.&#xA;If vertex 1 is the source vertex, then it is at level 0. Vertex 2 and 4 are at level 1 and vertex 3 and 5 are at level 2. Vertex 6 is at level 3.</description>

      <description>Depth first search explores on a single path in a graph as long as it find undiscovered vertices. When an edge leads to the discovered vertices it backtrack to the previous vertex and explores along the edge where it find undiscovered vertices. Finally it backtracks to the source vertex from where it started.&#xA;Initially all the vertices are white and when a vertex is discovered it becomes gray and then black when it is finished or processed.</description>

      <description>The nodes in a linked list are connected through pointers. Pointers represent the address of a location in a memory. The order in a linked list is determined by a pointer in each node. A node in a doubly circular linked list contains a data item and two node pointers, one to the previous node and one to the next node.

      <description>Given a Linked List, we have to find does loop exist in Linked List and if yes, find the length of loop.&#xA;To find loop in the linked list, we need two node pointers slowPtr and fastPtr which starts from the head. slowPtr increments by one node while fastPtr increments by two nodes. If these pointers point at the same node after starting from head then loop exists. This algorithm is known as Floyd Cycle Finding Algorithm.</description>

      <description>Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. In the input array there is a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. The algorithm repeatedly finds the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array and puts it at the end of the sorted portion of the array.&#xA;First the algorithm finds the smallest element in the array which is 1 and it is added to the sorted array and then the algorithm finds smallest element in the remaining array and so on.</description>

      <title>Merge Sort | C&#43;&#43; Implementation</title>

      <description>Merge sort follows divide-and-conquer approach. It divides an array of n elements into two subarrays of n/2 elements each. Then it sort the two subarrays recursively using merge sort. And then these subarrays are merged to produce a single sorted array.&#xA;If the size of the array is even then the size of subarrays is equal and if it is odd then first array has one element more than the second array.</description>

      <description>Insertion sort is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements. The algorithm selects an element from the unsorted array and put it in the proper position in the sorted. This process is repeated until all elements in the array are sorted. The sorting is in-place means array consists of sorted portion and unsorted portion in it.&#xA;The index of the key starts from 1. The algorithm finds the correct position of the key in the array and put the key at that position and then the element with next index becomes key.</description>

      <description>The nodes in a linked list are connected through pointers. Pointers represent the address of a location in a memory. The order in a linked list is determined by a pointer in each node. A node in a doubly linked list contains a data item and a node pointer to the next node. In a singly linked list we can traverse only in one direction.&#xA;The first node of the linked list is the head and the last node is the tail.</description>

      <description>A linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, is connected to the next element through a pointer. In a singly linked list, each node contains a data item and a pointer to the next node in the list. The order of the list is determined by the pointers, and the first node is called the head while the last node is called the tail. If the head is NULL, then the list is empty.</description>

      <description>Like mergesort, quicksort also follows divide-and-conquer approach. The algorithm selects an element as pivot. The input array is divided into two subarrays. All elements in left subarray are less than pivot and all elements in right subarray are greater than pivot. These two subarrays are sorted independently and then merged to form a single sorted array.&#xA;Related : Merge Sort&#xA;In fig. (a) 4 is selected as the pivot and in fig.</description>

      <guid>https://programmercave.com/C-Implementation-of-Heapsort-Sorting/</guid>
      <description>Heapsort is implemented using heap data structure. Heap helps us to represent binary tree without using any pointers. Using heap an array can be viewed as a binary tree and each node of the tree stores an element of the array.&#xA;There are two kinds of binary heaps: max-heaps and min-heaps. In max-heap, the value stored at the parent node is greater than the value stored at its children nodes. Thus in a max-heap, root node contains the largest element.</description>
