      <description>A prime number is an integer n &amp;gt; 1 which is only divisible by 1 and n(itself). For example, 2, 3, 5 are prime numbers, but 6, 8, 9 are not prime numbers.&#xA;Every integer n &amp;gt; 1 can be uniquely expressed as the product of prime numbers. For example 8 = 2 * 2 * 2.&#xA;A perfect number is a number n if n is equal to the sum of its factors between 1 and n â€“ 1.</description>
