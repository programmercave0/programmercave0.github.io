      <description>Definition of Indexing  Indexing is a technique used to improve the speed of data retrieval in databases by creating a separate data structure that maps search keys to their corresponding data locations.  Internal Structures   B-Tree Structure:
 The most common structure for indexes, allowing sorted data and efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.  B-Tree Diagram  [Root] / \ / \ [A] [B] / \ / \ [C] [D] [E] [F]   Leaf Nodes: Store actual data pointers.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: What is Database Sharding?</title>

      <description>Key Concepts of Database Sharding Definition:
 Database sharding is the process of partitioning a large database into smaller, manageable pieces called shards. Each shard operates independently and contains a subset of the total data, allowing for parallel processing and improved query performance.  Purpose:
 The main objective of sharding is to effectively manage large datasets. As applications grow, a single database instance may struggle with increased data volume and user demand, resulting in slower response times.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Why Go is One of the Fastest Programming Languages?</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Why-Go-is-One-of-the-Fastest-Programming-Languages/</link>

      <description>Explore the reasons why Go (Golang) is one of the fastest programming languages available today. This blog delves into key features that contribute to Go&amp;rsquo;s performance, including its compiled nature, efficient concurrency model with goroutines, optimized garbage collection, and simplicity in code design. Ideal for developers preparing for Golang interviews, this guide offers essential insights into how Go leverages modern hardware and achieves rapid compile times, making it a top choice for high-performance applications.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Build a Simple URL Shortener in Go</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Build-a-Simple-URL-Shortener-in-Go/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Build-a-Simple-URL-Shortener-in-Go/</guid>
      <description>In this blog post, we will build a simple URL shortener in Go. This will demonstrate how to generate short codes for long URLs, store them in memory, and retrieve the original URL from the short code. We will also ensure thread-safety for concurrent access to the in-memory store using sync.Mutex.
This question was asked to me by Radisys for the role of Golang Developer.
 Step 1: Data Structure for Storing URLs First, we need a place to store the URLs.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Thread-Safe Implementation of Map in Go</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Thread-Safe-Implementation-of-Map-in-Go/</link>

      <description>This blog demonstrates two approaches to implement a thread-safe map in Go: using sync.Mutex and the built-in sync.Map. These techniques ensure safe concurrent access to maps in multi-threaded environments.
This question was asked to me by Radisys for the role of Golang Developer.
 Approach 1: SafeMap with sync.Mutex This implementation uses sync.Mutex to synchronize access to a map.
Structure and Methods 1. SafeMap Struct Contains:
 mu sync.Mutex: The lock to synchronize map access.</description>
