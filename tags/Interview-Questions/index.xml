      <description>Concurrency is a cornerstone of modern software engineering, and Go (Golang) makes it accessible with Goroutines. If you’re preparing for a software engineering interview, understanding Goroutines is crucial. This guide breaks down Goroutines in simple terms, complete with examples and diagrams.
What Are Goroutines? A Goroutine is a lightweight execution thread managed by the Go runtime. Think of it as a function that runs independently and concurrently with other Goroutines.</description>

      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Goroutine-Scheduling-Preemptive-or-Nonpreemptive/</guid>
      <description>Understanding whether Goroutines are preemptively or nonpreemptively scheduled is critical for writing efficient concurrent code. Let’s break down how Go’s runtime manages Goroutines and why this hybrid model is unique.
Preemptive vs. Nonpreemptive Scheduling   Preemptive Scheduling:
 The scheduler can forcefully pause a running task (e.g., an OS thread) at any time to allow other tasks to run. Common in OS-level thread scheduling. Example: A thread running a loop can be interrupted mid-execution.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: What is an API Gateway?</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-is-an-API-Gateway/</link>

      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-is-an-API-Gateway/</guid>
      <description>What is an API Gateway? An API Gateway is a server that acts as a single entry point for all client requests. It routes these requests to the appropriate backend services and handles responses back to the client. This centralized approach helps in managing and securing APIs efficiently, making it an essential component in modern software architecture.
Key Concepts of API Gateway  Routing: Directing incoming requests to the correct backend service.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: How Microservices Communicate?</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-How-Microservices-Communicate/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-How-Microservices-Communicate/</guid>
      <description>Introduction to Microservices Communication Microservices architecture involves breaking down a large application into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other to achieve overall functionality. The way these services communicate is crucial for the system&amp;rsquo;s performance, scalability, and resilience.
Communication Patterns Between Microservices There are two main types of communication between microservices:
 Synchronous Communication Asynchronous Communication  Let’s explore both in detail.
Synchronous Communication In synchronous communication, one service sends a request to another service and waits for a response before proceeding.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Explain Caching</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Explain-Caching/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Explain-Caching/</guid>
      <description>Caching: The Secret Sauce for High-Performance Systems If you’re preparing for a software engineering interview, understanding caching is non-negotiable. Caching is a cornerstone of system design, optimizing performance by storing frequently accessed data in fast-access layers. Let’s break it down in simple terms.
 What is Caching? Caching stores copies of data in temporary, high-speed storage (like RAM) to reduce access times. Think of it like keeping your favorite snacks on your desk instead of walking to the kitchen every time you’re hungry—faster access, less effort.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Explain Consistent Hashing</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Explain-Consistent-Hashing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Explain-Consistent-Hashing/</guid>
      <description>What is Consistent Hashing? Imagine you’re distributing candy (data) among friends (servers). If a friend leaves or joins, you don’t want to reshuffle all the candy—only what’s necessary. Consistent hashing solves this problem by minimizing data movement when servers (nodes) are added or removed. It’s used by companies like Discord, Netflix, and Amazon DynamoDB to scale their systems efficiently.
 How Consistent Hashing Works: A Step-by-Step Guide 1. The Hash Ring: A Circular Timeline Think of a hash ring as a clock face.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Explain Load Balancer</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Explain-Load-Balancer/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Explain-Load-Balancer/</guid>
      <description>What is a Load Balancer? A load balancer acts like a traffic cop for your application, directing incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure smooth performance. It’s the entry point of your system, hiding server details and optimizing traffic flow.
 Placement: Sits at the edge of data centers (like a gatekeeper). Functionality:  Distributes traffic to servers. Proxies requests to hide server IPs (e.g., clients only see the load balancer’s IP).</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Explain CAP Theorem</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Explain-CAP-Theorem/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Explain-CAP-Theorem/</guid>
      <description>1. What is the CAP Theorem? The CAP Theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three properties at the same time:
 Consistency (C): All users see the same data simultaneously. Availability (A): The system always responds to requests (even with stale data). Partition Tolerance (P): The system works even if parts of it lose communication.  Key Insight: Network partitions (e.g., server crashes, dropped messages) are unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: What is Database Sharding?</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-is-Database-Sharding/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-is-Database-Sharding/</guid>
      <description>Key Concepts of Database Sharding Definition:
 Database sharding is the process of partitioning a large database into smaller, manageable pieces called shards. Each shard operates independently and contains a subset of the total data, allowing for parallel processing and improved query performance.  Purpose:
 The main objective of sharding is to effectively manage large datasets. As applications grow, a single database instance may struggle with increased data volume and user demand, resulting in slower response times.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Build a Simple URL Shortener in Go</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Build-a-Simple-URL-Shortener-in-Go/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Build-a-Simple-URL-Shortener-in-Go/</guid>
      <description>In this blog post, we will build a simple URL shortener in Go. This will demonstrate how to generate short codes for long URLs, store them in memory, and retrieve the original URL from the short code. We will also ensure thread-safety for concurrent access to the in-memory store using sync.Mutex.
This question was asked to me by Radisys for the role of Golang Developer.
 Step 1: Data Structure for Storing URLs First, we need a place to store the URLs.</description>
