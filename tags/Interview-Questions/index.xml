      <description>Introduction Imagine you’re building a zoo app in Golang where animals like dogs, cats, and llamas need to make sounds and move around. You could write separate functions for each animal, but that’d get messy fast. Enter Golang interfaces—a simple yet powerful tool that lets you handle different types with one neat solution. As a software engineer, I’ve seen this question pop up in interviews: &amp;ldquo;Why do we need interfaces in Golang when we can just define functions?</description>

      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-Are-Interfaces-in-Golang/</guid>
      <description>Key Takeaways Interfaces in Go define method signatures and enable polymorphism, abstraction, and modularity. Implicit Implementation means types automatically implement interfaces by defining required methods—no explicit declaration is needed. The Empty Interface (interface{}) can hold any value, making it useful for generic functions but requiring type assertions for safe usage. Interface Embedding allows reusability by combining multiple interfaces into one. Type Assertions and Type Switches are essential for working with the empty interface to extract underlying types at runtime.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: What is the difference between new() and make() in Golang?</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-is-the-difference-between-new-and-make-in-Golang/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-is-the-difference-between-new-and-make-in-Golang/</guid>
      <description>Key Takeaways new() allocates memory and returns a pointer to zeroed memory (e.g., *int, *struct). make() initializes slices, maps, or channels and returns a ready-to-use value (not a pointer). Use new() for basic types (int, bool) or structs when you need a pointer. Use make() for slices, maps, or channels to avoid runtime errors like nil pointers. Both functions handle memory automatically—no manual cleanup is required. Why Understanding new() and make() Matters in Go In Go, memory management is handled differently compared to languages like C or Java.</description>
