      <description>Basic Concepts  What is it? The &amp;ldquo;phonebook of the internet.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a distributed database that translates human-readable domain names (www.google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (142.250.191.78). Why is it needed? Because remembering IP addresses is hard for humans.  The DNS Resolution Process (Recursive Query) What happens when you type google.com into your browser?
 Browser/OS Cache: The browser first checks its own cache, then the OS cache. If the IP is found, the process stops here.</description>

      <guid>https://programmercave.com/HTTP-and-HTTPS/</guid>
      <description>Basic Concepts: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)  What is it? An application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It&amp;rsquo;s the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. Client-Server Model: HTTP is a request-response protocol. The client (e.g., browser) sends an HTTP Request, and the server (e.g., web server) returns an HTTP Response. Stateless: Each HTTP request is an independent transaction. The server does not retain any state between requests from the same client.</description>

      <guid>https://programmercave.com/TCP-vs-UDP/</guid>
      <description>Core Comparison    Feature TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) UDP (User Datagram Protocol)     Connection Connection-Oriented: Requires a &amp;ldquo;handshake&amp;rdquo; to establish a connection before data is sent. Connectionless: Just sends packets (datagrams) without establishing a connection. Fire-and-forget.   Reliability Reliable: Guarantees that data is delivered in the order it was sent and is error-checked. It retransmits lost packets. Unreliable: No guarantee of delivery, ordering, or error checking.</description>

      <title>0001 - The OSI and TCP IP Models</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/The-OSI-and-TCP-IP-Models/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/The-OSI-and-TCP-IP-Models/</guid>
      <description>What are they?
 They are conceptual models that standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system in terms of abstraction layers. They provide a common language for network engineers and software developers.  Key Difference:
 The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a more theoretical, 7-layer model. The TCP/IP model is a more practical, 4-layer model that is the foundation of the modern internet.  The OSI Model (7 Layers) Think of it with the mnemonic: &amp;ldquo;All People Seem To Need Data Processing.</description>

      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Golang-Map-Internals/</guid>
      <description>Key Points  Go maps are implemented as hash tables. Each hash table consists of buckets, and each bucket can hold up to 8 key-value pairs. The map header contains important metadata such as the number of entries, the number of buckets (which is always a power of two), and a random hash seed. Maps grow dynamically when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold or when there are too many overflow buckets.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: Why Do We Need Interfaces in Golang?</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Why-Do-We-Need-Interfaces-in-Golang/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-Why-Do-We-Need-Interfaces-in-Golang/</guid>
      <description>1. What Are Interfaces in Golang?  Definition: An interface in Go is a type that lists method signatures—no fields, no implementation, just a blueprint of behaviors. Purpose: Interfaces define what a type can do (behavior) rather than how it does it (implementation). This abstraction allows flexibility and reusability. Example: type Animal interface { Sound() string Move() string }  Any type that implements the Sound() and Move() methods automatically satisfies the Animal interface.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: What are Interfaces in Golang?</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-Are-Interfaces-in-Golang/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-Are-Interfaces-in-Golang/</guid>
      <description>Key Takeaways  Interfaces in Go define method signatures and enable polymorphism, abstraction, and modularity. Implicit Implementation means types automatically implement interfaces by defining required methods—no explicit declaration is needed. The Empty Interface (interface{}) can hold any value, making it useful for generic functions but requiring type assertions for safe usage. Interface Embedding allows reusability by combining multiple interfaces into one. Type Assertions and Type Switches are essential for working with the empty interface to extract underlying types at runtime.</description>

      <title>Interview Question: What is the difference between new() and make() in Golang?</title>
      <link>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-is-the-difference-between-new-and-make-in-Golang/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://programmercave.com/Interview-Question-What-is-the-difference-between-new-and-make-in-Golang/</guid>
      <description>Key Takeaways  new() allocates memory and returns a pointer to zeroed memory (e.g., *int, *struct). make() initializes slices, maps, or channels and returns a ready-to-use value (not a pointer). Use new() for basic types (int, bool) or structs when you need a pointer. Use make() for slices, maps, or channels to avoid runtime errors like nil pointers. Both functions handle memory automatically—no manual cleanup is required.  Why Understanding new() and make() Matters in Go In Go, memory management is handled differently compared to languages like C or Java.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, we will build a simple URL shortener in Go. This will demonstrate how to generate short codes for long URLs, store them in memory, and retrieve the original URL from the short code. We will also ensure thread-safety for concurrent access to the in-memory store using sync.Mutex.
This question was asked to me by Radisys for the role of Golang Developer.
 Step 1: Data Structure for Storing URLs First, we need a place to store the URLs.</description>

      <description>This blog demonstrates two approaches to implement a thread-safe map in Go: using sync.Mutex and the built-in sync.Map. These techniques ensure safe concurrent access to maps in multi-threaded environments.
This question was asked to me by Radisys for the role of Golang Developer.
 Approach 1: SafeMap with sync.Mutex This implementation uses sync.Mutex to synchronize access to a map.
Structure and Methods 1. SafeMap Struct Contains:
 mu sync.Mutex: The lock to synchronize map access.</description>
