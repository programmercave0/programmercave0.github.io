      <description>All data in computer is represented in binary i.e. in 0 or 1. Computers or machines do not understand our languages, they understand bits. Generally programmer do not care about operations at the bit level. But sometimes a programmer has to dive in a deeper level and work on bits.&#xA;Bits representation In programming, an n bit integer is stored as a binary number that consists of n bits. So a 32-bit integer consists of 32 bits and 64 bit integer consists of 64 bits.</description>
